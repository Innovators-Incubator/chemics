Terminal velocity
=================

An individual particle can be carried by a stream of gas when the gas velocity
exceeds the termnial velocity :math:`u_t` of the particle. However, in
fluidized bed reactors, entrainment of particles out of the bed may require a
gas velocity many times higher than the terminal velocity.
